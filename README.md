SMP to Stability workflow:

1. pre_processor:
	- read .pnt and make a profile with mecanical properties
	
2. instability_modelling: 
	- compute rc and S similar to Reuter 2015
	
3. post_processor: 
	- plotting tools
	- tools to combine instability metrics
	
--> the jupyter files (.ipynb) are for prototyping. They produce the relevant code to the .py files.
